## Installation

Start in the root directory and run `npm i` in the terminal to install required dependencies. Next, enter `npm run start` in the terminal to start the server and sync the Mongoose models to the MongoDB database.

## Usage
All dependencies must be installed in the terminal. After this, start the server in order to use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests in Insomnia Core.
